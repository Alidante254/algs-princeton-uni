# Princeton University Algorithms (Coursera)

Welcome to my Princeton University Algorithms Coursera repository! This repository is created to document my progress and showcase my work throughout the Algorithms courses offered by Princeton University on Coursera.

## Course Overview

This repository contains code implementations, assignments, and resources related to the Algorithms courses. The courses cover a range of essential topics in algorithms and data structures, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more. The courses are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of algorithms and their applications in computer science and related fields.

Courses Included:
1. Algorithms Part I
2. Algorithms Part II

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/Algorithms_Part_I`: Contains code implementations, solutions to assignments, and relevant resources for Algorithms Part I.
- `/Algorithms_Part_II`: Contains code implementations, solutions to assignments, and relevant resources for Algorithms Part II.
- `/Resources`: Includes supplementary resources, helpful links, and additional reading materials related to the courses.

## Progress

I will use the directories mentioned above to store my code solutions for assignments, lecture notes, and any additional work completed during the courses. I aim to maintain clean and organized code, ensuring that my solutions are both efficient and correct.

## Getting Started

To access the content of the Algorithms courses, you need to enroll in the corresponding courses offered by Princeton University on Coursera. You will find all the course materials, including lectures, assignments, and supplementary resources, on the Coursera platform.

Please note that this repository is for personal use, and the code and solutions are intended for educational purposes only. Always follow the academic integrity policies of your educational institution.

## Support and Collaboration

I encourage collaboration and discussion among fellow students taking the same courses. If you have any questions or ideas to share, feel free to open issues or create pull requests. Let's learn together and make the most of these challenging yet rewarding courses.

## Disclaimer

This repository is not officially affiliated with Princeton University or Coursera. It is created solely for my personal use as a student in the Algorithms courses.

Happy learning!
